									<h2>7+ years experience as an FP&A Professional</h2>
									<h3><em>I build things. I automate things. I visualise things. I do this all at scale.</em></h3>
									<p>I am a senior FP&A professional with 7+ years of experience in corporate finance, financial analysis, and FP&A.<br />
										I am adept at helping leadership execute its strategic, operational, and financial goals. I have scaled the financial modelling capabilities of large and small companies (Amazon, BCA, etc.) across multiple industries.<br /> 
										My achievements (View CV below) have shown I can learn, at speed, the landscape of an organisation, and optimise and scale.<br /><br />
										I spent my formative years specialising as a financial modeller and business partner.<br /> 
										I implement financial modelling best practises (like FAST) whilst optimising reporting and budgeting capabilities. 
										I optimise by centralising the financial modelling function, standardising best practices for creating models, and automating process flows through Power Query and BI.<br />
										I serve as a coach to the next gen of interns to improve their technical skills as well as soft skills.<br /> 
										I have implemented Wim Hof meditation inside of companies as well as externally. I have led guided meditation sessions throughout Luxembourg City, Barcelona, and the UK. 
										I personally implement Wim Hof as a framework to manage short and long-term stressors.<br /><br />
										<em>Since October 2021 i have taken time out to recentre, focus on myself, personal projects, and to plan the next 5 years of my career. Wim Hof has been beneficial during this time. I am now excited for my next journey and next role!</em><br /><br /> 
										<strong>Finance tech stack: </strong>Excel, VBA, Power Query, PowerBI (inc. DAX), SQL, COGNOS, TM1, R.<br /><br />
										<strong>Fun Fact 1: </strong> My Favourite tech skill is Power Query. It reshaped how i approach designing a data model and problem-solving.<br/><br />
										<strong>Fun Fact 2: </strong> I am a writer for <a href="https://fpa-trends.com/author/mohammed-hussain" target="_blank" style="color: red">FP&A Trends Group</a>. I have 2 articles coming out in the next 2 months. keep an eye out! :)</p>
